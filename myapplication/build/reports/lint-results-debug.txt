C:\Users\chuny\AndroidStudioProjects\week1\myapplication\build.gradle.kts:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

C:\Users\chuny\AndroidStudioProjects\week1\myapplication\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:14: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

           ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
